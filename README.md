# US and South Korea COVID-19 Outbreak Response Comparison & Analysis

- **Why** are you doing this project? 
	- Amid the Novel Coronavirus pandemic, I would like to provide a clear presentation of the different COVID-19 outbreak early responses, specifically South Korea and the United States, and their outcomes
    
- **How** do you imagine you'll accomplish this project? 
	- Collect COVID-19 data of both the United States and South Korea
	- Organize and manipulate collected data
	- Create interactive maps, charts, timelines
	- Compare and analyze


## Background

The initial idea behind this project was to create a tool to automate an interactive map for **contact tracing**. Contact tracing is a concept of tracing and monitoring contacts and travels of each confirmed case (infected person).  Sharing this data anonymously to the public and notifying people of their exposure.  Ultimately this helps to prevent additional transmission.  China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore effectively and successfully utilized technology for contact tracing and slowed the spread of coronavirus.  However, due to privacy concerns, western countries like the U.S., Italy, Spain, and France are experiencing difficulty deploying technology to share data on the confirmed cases. <br><br>
South Korea has been looked up to by many country leaders who are fighting against the novel coronavirus. South Korea is one of the few countries that are successfully beating the pandemic without a complete lockdown. I wanted to see how South Korea's approach and response to COVID-19 outbreak differed to the U.S.'. This will include not only COVID-19 related data (confirmed cases, fatalities, testing, etc.) but also each country administration's response including WHO/CDC/HHS's announcements and other administrative changes affected by coronavirus. I will then analyze the comparison and contrast with appropriate data visualization.

## Measuring Success: 

- How will you measure your project's sucess?
	- Is there some metric you'd hope to generate from your project.
    
	- Is there some plot or visualization that will be generated? 
        - There will be multiple plots and visualizations for easier understanding of input data.  I'll try to make them interactive as well.

	- Is some manual task now fully automated?
